Browser Commander
=================

This is an RPC server that lets you run Node `fs` and `child_process`
commands in your browser.

It's a shell, that uses that to implement a shell (think bash, not
xterm).

It's a tiling windowing system for the browser.

It's a file browser.

It's an editor.  (Really just Code Mirror, but editing files on your computer.)

It'll probably be other things too, why not?

To use
------

Run `npm install websocket node-static`

Then run `node server.js`

Then go to `http://localhost:8080/console.html`

There is no security.  It's not secure, be careful.
